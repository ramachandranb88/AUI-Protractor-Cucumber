Protractor - Cucumber Automation Framework (Typescript)
This is a Typescript based End-to-End (E2E) customized Test Automation Framework built on Open source selenium based cucumber BDD approach on  node js platform.

##Highlights:

It is an lightweight javascript based framework.
Behaviour Driven Development test framework defined using Gherkin syntax (Given, When & Then statements).
Page Object pattern technique has been used for making the tests more readable and maintainable.
Domain Specific Language (DSL) driven testing framework for writing comprehensive automated testing suites.
Plugged in Cucumber report for details test report with screenshots embedded into report file on failed steps
Can be extended to cloud platforms - Nightwatch cloud, Aplittoos & Browser stack

Protractor with Typescript:
Protractor with Typescript provides properties tied to the global namespace through a simple import. From that imported property we can get auto completion, method signature, and the JSDoc. 

The benefits of Protractor with Typescript includes –
Strong Static Typing : This feature provide statement completion, find references, navigation to definitions, and refactoring. This benefits the ability to catch errors early.
Object Oriented Programming Support: Classes in Typescript work mostly the same as classes in other object-oriented languages. This gives an ease in development of well-structured BDD/TDD automation frameworks for Angular, react and node based application projects.
Generics: Enables Reusable component building
Code/Text editor or IDE support: Most Widely used IDE’s readily supports Typescript. Text editors such as - Visual Studio Code, Atom and Sublime Text with plugin (atom-typescript and Typescript-Sublime-Plugin), etc.,

The above features enables/supports:
Easy adaptability of automation script development into protractor for Angular JS and Node JS based automation.
Typescript also reduces the complexities and training required in understanding the approach and development of test scripts for automation testers with knowledge/experience only on Java/C#(Oops based) automation frameworks.
